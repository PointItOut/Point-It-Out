# POINT-IT-OUT:

Point-it-out is a augmented-reality review game you can play alone or with a friend. It works on any computer with a webcam. Users race against the clock to answer as many questions as possible, earning points (and the possibility to sabotage your opponent!) along the way. Teachers, students, and game night hosts can create their own quizzes tailored to their needs. To check it out for yourself, head on over to https://point-it-out.herokuapp.com
